# Loan Prediction Model

A Deep Learning model was created to predict whether a person would pay back their loan or not.

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and first, Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to find relations between the various features of the dataset.

Then, the data was cleaned to remove redundant data as well as null values that may have been present in the dataset.

Lastly, a neural network with 2 hidden dense layers was made, and a model was created after training the dataset on the neural network. The model ended up with an accuract of close to 90%.
